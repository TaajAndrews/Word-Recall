// ================== JavaScript ========================= //
// Create a word bank stored in an array of objects with 10 words for an MVP
// Create a play button that begins the game and iterates over the word bank array (for MVP)
// Players can select word buttons on the screen
// After the player selects their word, the next word and word bank replaces the previous word and the input field turns gold to indicate the correct word was used
// Players can only use a letter once, so there needs to be guards in place against that
// For MVP, there will not be a back button, you will need to input in the correct order
// track the words that were used in a temporary variable so when played, they will not be used until after the round
// After each round we can reset the used words so they can be included in the word bank again
// Reset all variables and begin again

// ICE BOX: You can input words into the game by typing
// ICE BOX: Once players input a word, they will have a back (erase) button in case they selected the wrong letter
// ================== 1ST HTML PAGE ========================= //
// Main game board that looks like wireframe, with a play button
// CSS Media query: responsive design adjusts for mobile; button size changes
// ICE BOX: Main game page consists of the game with the board and everything behind the play button blurred out

// ================== 2nd HTML PAGE ========================= //

// HTML index page two:
// Page with main header image for game
// Page has game instructions and game benefits
// ICE BOX: This page can also list all of the top scores
